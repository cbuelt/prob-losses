# Probabilistic losses

This repository contains several implementations of losses used in probabilistic forecasting.
The implemented losses (or scores) are the following:

- Quantile score
- Interval score
- Continuously ranked probability score (CRPS)
  - Normal distribution
  - Truncated normal distribution
  - Log-normal distribution
- Energy Score
- Variogram Score (of order p)
